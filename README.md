# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a Movie Recommendation System developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the concepts of cosine similarity and stemming. The system analyzes movie descriptions and computes similarity scores to recommend five movies similar to the selected one. By leveraging cosine similarity, it efficiently identifies movies with related content, and stemming ensures better text matching by processing keywords. The project also includes a user-friendly website interface, making it easy to select a movie and view recommendations instantly. This system provides an engaging and effective solution for movie enthusiasts seeking personalized suggestions based on their preferences.
